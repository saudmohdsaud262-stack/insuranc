# 📊 Insurance Data Analysis Project  

Welcome to the **Insurance Data Analysis** project! 🚀  
This project explores an **insurance dataset** containing demographic, lifestyle, and medical cost information.  

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains **1338 records** and the following columns:  

- 👤 **Age** – Age of the insured person  
- 🚻 **Sex** – Gender (male/female)  
- ⚖️ **BMI** – Body Mass Index  
- 👶 **Children** – Number of dependents  
- 🚬 **Smoker** – Smoking status (yes/no)  
- 🌍 **Region** – Residential region (northwest, southwest, southeast, northeast)  
- 💰 **Charges** – Medical costs billed by insurance  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### ✅ Univariate Analysis  
- 📈 Distribution of **age, BMI, and charges**  
- 📊 Count plots for **sex, children, smoker**  

### ✅ Bivariate Analysis  
- 📉 Charges vs. Age  
- 📊 Charges vs. Sex  
- 📉 Charges vs. Smoker  

### ✅ Multivariate Analysis  
- 🔗 Correlation between features  
- 📊 Boxplots for categorical vs. charges

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used  
- 🐼 **Pandas** – Data handling  
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** – Label Encoding & preprocessing  

---

## 🚀 Key Insights  
- 🧑‍🦳 Older people tend to have **higher insurance charges**.  
- 🚬 Smokers have **significantly higher costs** compared to non-smokers.  
- ⚖️ BMI is positively correlated with charges.
